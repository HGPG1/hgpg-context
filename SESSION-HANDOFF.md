# Session Handoff

## Last session: 2026-05-06 — Brain App MVP shipped 🟢

### What got built
- New Vercel project: `brain-app` on team `team_FietQPKCmnyioG2n0FdteQCV`
- New repo: `HGPG1/brain-app` (private)
- Live at: `https://brain.homegrownpropertygroup.com`
- Stack: Next.js 16.2.4, Tailwind v4, CodeMirror 6, Supabase Auth (magic link)
- Single-user lock: `BRIAN_EMAIL=brian@homegrownpropertygroup.com` allow-list
- GitHub auth: fine-grained PAT scoped to `HGPG1/hgpg-context`, contents:write only
- Round-trip verified: edit file in browser → commit lands on `main` with author `brian@homegrownpropertygroup.com`

### Infra changes that affect other apps
- Resend custom SMTP wired into `HGPG Core` Supabase (project `ioypqogunwsoucgsnmla`)
  - Sender: `noreply@homegrownpropertygroup.com`, name: HGPG
  - API key stored under "Supabase HGPG Core" in Resend
  - Rate limit went from 2/hr (Supabase default) to 30/hr (Resend default), can be raised
  - This affects ALL apps using this Supabase: TM, CMA, TC Concierge, brain-app
- Supabase project renames for hygiene:
  - `ioypqogunwsoucgsnmla` → "HGPG Core"
  - `ngdrliyjtqcwhhfrbxao` → "HGPG FUB Integration" (verify)
  - `wdheejgmrqzqxvgjvfee` → "HGPG Listing Reports + MLS" (verify)
  - `fkxgdqfnowskflgbuxhm` → "HGPG Signature + Relocation" (verify)
- Supabase `HGPG Core` redirect URLs added:
  - `https://brain.homegrownpropertygroup.com/**`
  - `http://localhost:3000/**`
  - (Existing tools.hgpg entries left intact)

### Bugs found and fixed mid-session
- Magic link redirected to `tools.homegrownpropertygroup.com` (Supabase Site URL fallback) — fixed by adding `/auth/callback` route handler that was missing from initial scaffold + pointing `emailRedirectTo` at it
- Supabase free SMTP rate limit (2/hr) hit during testing — fixed permanently by switching to Resend custom SMTP

### Project status updates
- `projects/brain-app.md` — status now 🟢 SHIPPED (was 🟡)
- `projects/hgpg-team-tools2.md` — Site URL in Supabase still points here for the broken app's eventual fix
- `projects/transaction-manager.md` — no changes today, but TM benefits from Resend SMTP upgrade

### Deferred / Phase 2 for brain-app
- iPhone smoke test (CodeMirror + iOS soft keyboard scroll behavior)
- Cooper Hewitt self-hosted (currently falling back to system sans)
- File rename and delete
- Diff view before save
- Cross-file search

### Pickup notes for next session
- Brain-app is live and working — use it for any future updates to `hgpg-context`
- Resend API key is in 1Password ("Supabase HGPG Core SMTP")
- Brain-app local dev: `cd ~/brain-app && npm run dev` on Mac mini (work machine)
- Brain-app local on iMac: same setup, repo at `~/Developer/brain-app` if rebuilt, otherwise needs fresh `gh repo clone HGPG1/brain-app` + `npm install` + `cp env.example .env.local`
- The `package-lock.json` may differ between iMac and Mac mini — push from whichever machine you most recently ran `npm install` on
